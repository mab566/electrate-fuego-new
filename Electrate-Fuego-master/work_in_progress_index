<!--Hello maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it--for this might be a really intersection on your way to becoming. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other, but explains a little more about the discourse communities that have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual. 

You could do it the easy way like I once did: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/ , or you can do a little more unconcealing...not just unconcealing who you are, but opening these tools that you use everyday, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to really understand our tools and how they work. So let's cut it all open--using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it...lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! 

In this doc., you will work through Gregory Ulmer's four discourses of family, entertainment, community, and schooling ((2002). Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy.) Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. I hope you are excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own Electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want--><!--this other stuff below the title does important work to help tell different browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->

You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder (directory) as this project (hint: simplify the name).

  <h2>Both of my parents work at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, so education has always been something that was emphasized and encouraged in my family. 
  
  I have a younger sister who loves to call me and chat but hates to be asked to do anything. Growing up with her taught me the importance of negiotations, mediations, teamwork, and when to stand your ground.
  
  My family also has a dog named Lucy, short for Lucifer. We've had her since she was a puppy, and she's taught me the value of patience. 
  
  My family has helped shape me into the person I am. They've encouraged me to aim high, and I wouldn't be here if they hadn't made me into the person that I am today.</div>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Gregory Ulmer, who we discussed above, says that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person and how you language yourself. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You will have some opportunities to add video content or other content. You might add an image (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) or perhaps add a photo grid like the one you did for "Family." Experiment. You can't break this thing!

  <h2>The first book in the Raven Cycle series was one of the first books I read with the book club at my high school. It's a difficult to describe because, as my one friend likes to say, it doesn't have a plot, but two of the major themes of the series are friendship and identity. These themes felt particularly relevant as I was trying to find my footing in my new school.
  
  It was through this book and book club that I began the process of finding my voice and the friends I wanted to share things with. About four years later, I decided to do a reread and got my new friends into the book series as well. In fact, we all liked the books so much, that we ended up going to Massanutten, Virginia, where the books take place.</h2>

  <h2>To me, community is about finding a like-minded group of people and celebrating the things that you share. 
  For me, community means working to grow connections for myself and others as President of the statistics club here at Pitt. 
  It also means my friendships and the space we've worked to build togther whether we're watching movies, playing games, or traveling together across the country. My friends are a community that I am proud to be a part of.</h2>

  <h2> I attended Catholic school from Kindergarten through Eighth Grade, which is exactly as terrible as you might imagine.
  I then attended public high school where I, arguably, learned how to be a normal human being.I also had some of the most formative teachers and experiences. It was because of my high school U.S. History teacher that I got into statistics. He was the coach for the baseball team and asked me to do some basic statistics for the Varsity team.
  
  That experience took me a little out of my comfort zone with a different kind of calculations, but it was an experience that I really enjoyed. It was because of my experience doing sports stats that I decided to take A.P. Statistics my senior year of high school. During that class I found what I felt had been missing from my math classes, real-world application. </h2>
